## Key Differences Between Git and GitHub

1. **Git is a Version Control System, GitHub is a Hosting Service**  
   - **Git**: A local tool used to track changes in  code, manage versions, and allow multiple developers to collaborate on a project.
   - **GitHub**: A cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories, facilitating collaboration, and sharing code with others online.

2. **Git Works Locally, GitHub Requires Internet**  
   - **Git**: Works on the computer without needing an internet connection. We can manage repositories locally.
   - **GitHub**: Requires an internet connection to store code remotely and share it with others or collaborate online.
